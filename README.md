## Bio

I design and implement community technologies using P2P consensus protocols. Blockchains enable new disruptive ways to bring communities together.

Over the last 8 years, I've been involved in dozens of P2P projects across many industries including : finance, supply chain management, project governance, real estate, IOT, food, agriculture, and healthcare.

I share John Perry Barlow's vision for our nascent noosphere: [Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence).
